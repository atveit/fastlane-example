# Dynamic generation of the ipa file
# I'm using Shenzhen by Mattt, but you can use any build tool you want
# Remove the whole block if you do not want to upload an ipa file
ipa do
  # Add any code you want, like incrementing the build 
  # number or changing the app identifier

  # Attention: When you return a valid ipa file, this file will get uploaded and released
  # If you only want to upload app metadata, remove the complete ipa block.
